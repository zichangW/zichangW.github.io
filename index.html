<p><strong>Storyboard 1: Dyllan’s Experience</strong></p>
<p><img src="/2023/12/01/report6/clip_image008.jpg" alt="clip_image008"></p>
<p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> With the increasing number of urban population, the crowding out of medical resources has become more and more obvious, and it has become more and more troublesome for people to see a doctor in the hospital. Storyboard1 is Alice’s experience. From arriving at the hospital in the morning, filling out documents, registering in line, and then calling the doctor, her patience was gradually exhausted. It was already afternoon when she came out of the hospital, and she was exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>Solution Proposal:</strong> We plan to develop an online health care system, so that patients can make hospital appointments in advance online. At the same time, some minor diseases can be directly consulted with doctors remotely on the platform, and drugs can be delivered directly to their homes through drug stores. Storyboard2 is one of Dyllan’s real-life experiences.</p>

<p><img src="/2023/11/11/report2/clip_image002.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Analysis Conclusion:</p>
<p>According to the data table, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<p>\1.   <strong>More than half</strong> have been on Twitter for more than <strong>2 years</strong>;</p>
<p>\2.   20% used it for no more than 6 months, and 20% used it for more than 5 years;</p>
<p>\3.   The number of people using the time period of 6 months to 1 year is slightly smaller than that of 1 to 2 years;</p>
<p>\4.   Most people have used Twitter for more than 2 years, which may indicate that Twitter has some loyalty in the social media market.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/11/report2/clip_image004.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/11/report2/clip_image006.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Analysis conclusion: According to the data table, the number of effective fillers of this question is 15. Of those 15, <strong>daily active</strong> users make up more than half , <strong>60%</strong> use Twitter on <strong>mobile</strong>, <strong>33.33%</strong> on <strong>desktop</strong>, and <strong>6.67%</strong> on <strong>tablet</strong>. It can be concluded that mobile devices are the most popular type of device to use Twitter, followed by desktop computers and tablets are the least used. This data provides an important feedback for app developers: <strong>optimize the mobile app experience for more users</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/11/report2/clip_image008.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<h4 id="Analysis-conclusion"><a href="#Analysis-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Analysis conclusion:"></a>Analysis conclusion:</h4><p>Ø Of the notifications given, <strong>New followers</strong>, <strong>Likes</strong>, and <strong>Mentions</strong> are the most popular, accounting for <strong>73.33%</strong>, <strong>60%</strong>, and <strong>53.33%</strong> of the total active users.</p>
<p>Ø Proportionally, users pay significantly more attention to new followers than the other options, probably because they want more exposure from the number of followers. However, like and mention notifications reflect the user’s need for approval and attention from others, respectively.</p>
<p>Ø Other options such as <strong>Retweets</strong>, <strong>Trends</strong>, <strong>Recommended content</strong>, <strong>DMs</strong>, etc., have a relatively low proportion of followers, possibly reflecting the relatively low importance users place on these types of notifications.</p>
<p>In general, users are more interested in types of notifications that increase their visibility and gain recognition from others. More research and optimization in notification strategy and product design may be needed on how to balance the priorities of various types of notifications and improve user satisfaction.</p>
<p><img src="/2023/11/11/report2/clip_image010.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>The takeaway: According to the spreadsheet, <strong>46.67%</strong> of them rated Twitter’s algorithm as a 3 for personalizing their content. <strong>33.33%</strong> rated the performance good and chose 4; 6.67% of them considered the performance excellent and chose 5 points; However, 13.33 percent considered the performance poor and chose 2 points. In general, most people have a relatively positive attitude towards Twitter’s performance of algorithm personalization.</p>
<p>\3) Write a paragraph to describe what we learned: themes, categories, things that </p>
<p>are unexpected or surprised us </p>
<p>Based on the survey data collected, several key themes and findings emerged:</p>
<p>\1.   First, users vary widely in their engagement duration on Twitter, with most of them active for more than two years, suggesting a sense of loyalty among the user base. Interestingly, the distribution of user duration shows peaks at both ends, with 20% of users joining recently (within 6 months) and another 20% being long-term users (more than 5 years). This dichotomy may provide opportunities for targeted engagement strategies for both new and long-term users.</p>
<p>\2.   The second topic is about the preferred device for accessing Twitter. It is worth noting that more than half of daily active users access the platform through mobile devices, which highlights the importance of optimizing the mobile app experience. Desktop computers followed at 33.33 percent and tablets at 6.67 percent. This perspective is crucial for application developers, emphasizing the need to focus on enhancing the mobile user experience to cater to the majority of users.</p>
<p>\3.   The third topic concerns user engagement with notifications. New followers, likes, and mentions were the most popular notifications, accounting for 73.33%, 60%, and 53.33% of the total active users, respectively. This demonstrates the strong desire of the user community for exposure, approval, and attention. Conversely, the low percentages of options such as retweet, trend, recommended content, and direct messages indicate that users place relatively low importance on these types of notifications. This meticulous understanding of user preferences can guide feature development and content prioritization to align with user expectations and improve overall satisfaction.</p>
<p>Valuable feedback that could have a significant impact on product strategy was obtained through this survey. As we move forward, these findings will guide our efforts to increase user engagement, improve the mobile app experience, and prioritize features that match user expectations, ultimately ensuring a more satisfying and tailored Twitter experience for all users.</p>

</div>





<p>Analysis Summary:</p>
<p>​      The affinity diagram reveals divergent user perspectives on Twitter usage and expectations, providing valuable insights for product improvement and targeted marketing. Recognizing these differences, marketing teams can tailor strategies to meet the specific needs of diverse user groups. Additionally, the shared concern for data privacy underscores the importance of emphasizing security and privacy protection in product development.</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>\1. In analyzing the interview responses from the four users, several recurring themes and distinct categories emerged, shedding light on the diverse perspectives and priorities of potential Twitter users. The overarching theme of the real-time nature and global reach of Twitter resonated across all users, emphasizing its role as a rapid information source and a platform for connecting with like-minded individuals. </p>
<p>\2. However, the specific nuances of user experiences and expectations fell into several categories. The first category, “Twitter Usage and Preferences,” revealed motivations for using Twitter, its appeal, and how users balance their time on the platform. The second category, “Twitter Experience and Feedback,” delved into what users enjoy about Twitter, their reasons for continued use, interactions with others, challenges faced, and the envisioned role of Twitter within their broader online presence. The third category, “Twitter Integration and Enhancement,” explored the importance of seamless integration with other platforms, desired features or changes, ways to manage online presence, data privacy concerns, and the perceived value Twitter adds to their social media strategy. These categories provide valuable insights for product development, marketing, and addressing user concerns to enhance the overall Twitter experience for different user segments.</p>
<p>3)Write a paragraph describing what you learned: themes, categories, things that </p>
<p>are unexpected or surprised you.</p>
<p>From the interview records of Twitter users mentioned above, we can learn many interesting information about Twitter usage and preferences. The main themes include Twitter’s usage motivation, users’ views on the platform, their interactions and experiences on Twitter, and their suggestions for future improvements to the platform.</p>
<p>Topic 1: Twitter usage and preferences</p>
