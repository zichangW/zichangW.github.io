By collecting interview records and survey data from potential users, we can better understand their needs, interests, and concerns, in order to develop more targeted market strategies and improve user growth rates.</p>
<h5 id="Project-purpose"><a href="#Project-purpose" class="headerlink" title="Project purpose"></a><strong>Project purpose</strong></h5><p>This project aims to understand the needs, preferences, behaviors, and satisfaction of potential users of the Twitter website, in order to provide basis and suggestions for the improvement and promotion of the Twitter website.</p>
<h5 id="Project-Method"><a href="#Project-Method" class="headerlink" title="Project Method"></a><strong>Project Method</strong></h5><p>This project will use the following two methods for data collection:</p>
<p>Interview method: Conduct semi-structured interviews with potential users via phone or video to understand their understanding, attitude, usage, and expectations of the Twitter website. The interview will be conducted according to a pre designed interview guide, which includes the following main questions:</p>
<p>Topic 1: Twitter Usage and Preferences</p>
